1. Purpose

The purpose of this security policy is to establish guidelines and practices to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our organization's information assets and IT infrastructure.

2. Information Classification

All information assets must be classified based on their sensitivity and importance. Access controls and protective measures will be implemented according to the assigned classification.

    Public: Information intended for public consumption.
    Internal: Information for internal use only.
    Confidential: Highly sensitive information requiring strict access controls.

3. Access Controls

Access to information systems and data will be granted based on the principle of least privilege. Employees will have access only to the resources necessary for their roles.

4. Authentication and Authorization

User authentication and authorization mechanisms will be implemented to ensure that only authorized individuals can access specific resources. Strong password policies will be enforced.

5. Data Encryption

Sensitive data, both in transit and at rest, will be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms to prevent unauthorized access.

6. Incident Response

An incident response plan will be established to address and mitigate security incidents promptly. Employees will be trained on recognizing and reporting security incidents.

7. Regular Audits and Monitoring

Regular security audits and monitoring will be conducted to identify and address vulnerabilities, unauthorized activities, and potential security threats.

8. Physical Security

Physical access to data centers, server rooms, and other critical infrastructure will be restricted to authorized personnel only. Surveillance measures will be in place.

9. Employee Training

Employees will undergo security awareness training to educate them about security best practices, the importance of confidentiality, and the potential risks associated with their roles.
